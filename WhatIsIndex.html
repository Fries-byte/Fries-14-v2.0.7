    <h1>Why'd i make this?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I made this website because i was bored and wanted to make my own "search engine",</p>
    <p>and what did i pick? &udm=14 ofc! it didnt get any updates, its simple to code, and</p>
    <p>its perfect, so i started to make the project &Fries=14, i used Visual Studio Code</p>
    <p>since its recommeded for programmers. i made some changes like, Logo, Title, Links, etc</p>
    <p>and it was done. &Fries=14 v1.0, it was good enough to publish to GitHub</p>
    <p>i also thought if i should make updates daily or so, thats all i have to say!</p>
    <p>thank you for reading!</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>it's inspired by udm=14<p>

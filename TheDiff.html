    <h1>What Is The Difference Of Regular and Fries-Free?</h1>
    <strong>Awnser;</strong>
    <p>Regular. Regular State where it will add "&udm=14" in the url that you've searched</p>
    <p>which prevents AI-Search and ADs.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Fries-Free. Fries-Free will NOT prevent AI-Search and ADs, its abit useless. but cant be time waisting</p>
